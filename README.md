## Overview

### The challenge

We were challenged with developing our own API DB in MongoDB, it needed to have Post, Put, Delete, Get All, and Get by ID for Users, and Thoughts. It needed a way to add friends and delete friends, as well as add reactions, and delete reactions to thoughts.

## Aknowledgement 
- Thank you to Andrea Herbert for her helpful youtube video when I was struggling with making delete/update User/Thought work. Which is why the code in those areas run just (req, res) instead of ({params, res}) in the function props.
